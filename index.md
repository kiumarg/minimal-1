1. Evidence and Incoherence (revise & resubmit)
    - Abstract
        
        I argue against an ambitious account of irrationality of logical incoherence, which I labeled *Reductive Evidentialism.* This view seeks to explain away all logical/structural requirements of rationality in terms of responsiveness to evidence. I argue that this view has to be rejected because it lacks the resources to maintain one of the central assumptions that it needs, namely, *intra-*subjective uniqueness: i.e., that a given individual’s body of evidence cannot permit believing both $P$ and $\neg P$ .
        
2. [new] Coherence, Conflict, and Tragedy (under review)
    - Abstract
        
        This paper argues, contra a growing trend in the literature on the norms of rationality, that the so-called “conflict cases” do not justify modification or skepticism about norms of rationality. Conflict cases are supposed to be examples in which norms of coherence, on the one hand, and the norms of responsiveness to evidence, on the other, come into conflict. The paper argues that the illusion that these cases force us to choose between the norms of rationality can be traced to a deprived model of what it is for norms of rationality to generate “requirements”. Once this is realized and a suitable alternative model is adopted, it becomes possible to accept conflict cases without the pressure to modify or reject the norms.
